# AltSchool First Semester Project | Scissors Web

Replicated the Scissors Web.
This is the Scissors Web project, a user-friendly and efficient URL shortening application. This React-based web application is built with a focus on simplicity, practicality, and enhanced user experience. It's a replica of a project that was part of my journey in learning software development at AltSchool Africa. This project aims to provide a seamless and straightforward solution for shortening URLs, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for quick link generation.
NB: The link shortening is only a placeholder and doesn't work yet
